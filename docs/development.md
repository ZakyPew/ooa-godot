# Development

## Requirements

- Godot 4.7.1 with .NET support
- .NET 8 SDK and PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`)
- A clean US Oracle of Ages ROM with MD5
  `C4639CC61C049E5A085526BB6CAC03BB`
- A local vanilla `oracles-disasm` checkout (`master`, not `hack-base`)

The current environment uses:

```text
Repository:     E:\Stuff\Github\ooa-godot
Disassembly:    E:\Stuff\Github\oracles-disasm
Godot console:  E:\Stuff\Gamedev\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_mono_win64_console.exe
```

Pass `-Rom` or `-Disassembly` to the importer for other locations. Never commit
the ROM.

On macOS, install the .NET 8 SDK and PowerShell 7, then download the official
Godot 4.7.1 .NET / Mono universal build from
[Godot's 4.7.1 release](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases/tag/4.7.1-stable).
The GUI/editor and command-line executable are inside the extracted `.app`
bundle. Set `GODOT_BIN` to the full path of its `Contents/MacOS/Godot`
executable, or pass that path with `-Godot` when running the validation script.
Use `pwsh` for the PowerShell importer and validation scripts.

## Common commands

Import or refresh generated assets:

```powershell
& .\tools\import_oracles.ps1
```

For importer infrastructure, parser, schema, or deterministic-output changes:

```powershell
& .\tools\verify_oracle_import.ps1
```

Build both production and validation assemblies:

```powershell
dotnet build
```

Run the normal game flow:

```powershell
& 'E:\Stuff\Gamedev\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_mono_win64.exe' --path .
```

Start directly in a hexadecimal room for development:

```powershell
& 'E:\Stuff\Gamedev\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_mono_win64.exe' --path . -- --group=4 --room=04
```

Project arguments must follow `--`. Direct room starts bypass retail file and
checkpoint progression. For a side-scrolling dungeon room, name its source
group (`4` or `5`); the development loader performs the retail active-group
switch to `6` or `7`.

After building, run all headless validations with the standard 8 workers,
or one exact registered method. The `godot` command below should be the
platform's Godot .NET executable (`Godot.exe` on Windows or the executable
inside the macOS app bundle):

```powershell
$godot = $env:GODOT_BIN
& ./tools/validate_parallel.ps1 -Godot $godot
& $godot --headless --path . --quit-after 10 -- --validate --validate-only=ValidateMethodName
```

See [Validation](validation.md) for scenario isolation and handoff checks.

## Android export

The `Android` export preset produces an ARM64 APK for sideloading. Install the
matching Godot .NET Android export templates, and configure the Java SDK and
Android SDK paths in Godot's editor settings. The project targets .NET 9 for
Android; the .NET SDK must support publishing that target.
Android exports enable C# optimization even for debug-signed APKs, since the
original sound interpreter and APU must synthesize audio in real time.

After building and running validation, export with:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force builds/android | Out-Null
& 'E:\Stuff\Gamedev\Godot\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_mono_win64_console.exe' --headless --path . --export-debug Android builds/android/oracle-of-ages.apk
```

This creates a debug-signed APK, not a store release. Release exports require a
release signing key configured locally. Keep signing credentials out of source
control. Export output under `builds/` is ignored.

The preset includes generated `.bin`, `.tsv`, and `.2bpp` files explicitly;
Godot's resource export alone does not include these runtime inputs. Imported
graphics are exported as Godot resources. Regenerate assets before exporting
only when their source inputs or importer have changed.

Android currently uses the existing gamepad/keyboard controls below. Touch
controls have not been implemented.

## Controls

| Action | Keyboard | Gamepad |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Move | Arrow keys or WASD | D-pad/stick |
| A / sword | Z or K | A |
| B / equipped item | X or J | B |
| Start / inventory | I or Enter | Start |
| Select / map | M or Tab | Back |
| Save & Quit | Start + Select | Start + Back |

Development-only controls:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| F | Map/room fast travel; cycle group pages while open |
| F1 | Edit live flags, linked state, items, and appraised rings |
| F2 | Toggle Link collision |
| F3 | Arrange a normal Maple encounter |
| F4 | Spawn enemies and item drops at room coordinates |
| F5 | Toggle 4× fast forward (also works in the title flow and menus) |
| V | Warp to the configured debug room (default `4:11`) |
| Shift + 0-9 | Save a debug savestate |
| 0-9 | Load a debug savestate |

Fast forward starts disabled and displays `FF x4` beside the room ID while
enabled. It runs extra complete 60 Hz updates, including audio sequencing;
audio output may skip as its existing queue bounds latency.

The F4 spawner pauses gameplay. Up/down selects a field; left/right changes
the category, object ID/sub-ID variant, or coordinate (in eight-pixel steps).
M/Tab advances ten objects for faster browsing.
The sprite preview uses imported OAM and palettes without creating an actor or
advancing gameplay. Entries without imported preview graphics show `NO IMAGE`.
Coordinates start at Link's room position, including in large rooms. A/Z creates
one object per press; B/X or F4 closes the menu. The enemy list uses imported
names and classifications; entries without a standalone combat handler report
that limitation. NPCs, bosses, and room-event controllers are outside this tool's
scope. Enemy creation uses the shared 16-slot allocator and normal AI/RNG, with
room-completion counting and placed-enemy defeat bits disabled. Drops use their
normal collection behavior. Spawned objects are transient and disappear on room
reload; their ordinary gameplay effects can still change live state.

Override the V target with `--debug-warp-group=` and
`--debug-warp-room=`. Debug tools mutate live state and do not bypass the
project's explicit-save rules. Debug savestates are separate from the three
retail-compatible file slots.

On F1's items page, selecting `FLUTE_00`, `FLUTE_01`, or `FLUTE_02` switches
the companion to Ricky, Dimitri, or Moosh and grants its callable flute. Equip
it on A or B and play it in a supported present overworld room to summon that
companion. Normal shop/minigame Strange Flutes still require the forest quest.
Closing F1 after a companion change
in Nuun Highlands reloads its terrain and entities and moves Link to safe
ground. Quest progress is retained.

## Change cycle

1. Inspect `git status --short` and preserve unrelated changes.
2. Trace the relevant ROM/disassembly behavior, including callers and tables.
3. Identify the authoritative importer and runtime owner.
4. Extend the importer before runtime code when generated data is incomplete.
5. Implement the behavior and focused regression together.
6. Regenerate affected assets and review their diff.
7. Run the appropriate import checks, `dotnet build`, the full headless suite,
   `git diff --check`, and `git status --short`.
8. Update a guide only if a durable rule changed; update
   [implementation status](implementation-status.md) only for a broad coverage
   change.

Use `rg` for repository and disassembly searches. Inspect pixel-sensitive work
at an integer scale; the internal viewport is 160 by 144.

## Continuous validation

[The validation workflow](../.github/workflows/validation.yml) rebuilds the
supported ROM from pinned public sources, verifies its MD5, runs importer
ownership and determinism checks, builds with warnings as errors, downloads the
pinned Godot .NET version, runs the complete headless suite, rejects Godot
warnings/errors, and runs `git diff --check`.

Version and checksum pins for Godot, WLA-DX, and the disassembly must change
together and pass the complete workflow. The temporary ROM is never uploaded as
an artifact.
