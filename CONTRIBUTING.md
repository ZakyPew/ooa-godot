# Contributing to ooa-godot

Gameplay, validation, tools, and documentation contributions are welcome.
Keep each pull request focused, include a deterministic validation for behavior
changes, and report exactly what you ran.

## Development branch and pull requests

The active Epoch-maintained development branch is
[`codex/mod-asset-overlays`](https://github.com/ZakyPew/ooa-godot/tree/codex/mod-asset-overlays).
Fork this repository, create your feature branch from that branch, push it to
your fork, and open a PR here with the base branch set to
`codex/mod-asset-overlays`. Do not target the upstream project's repository.

Example from an Epoch checkout (PowerShell on Windows or `pwsh` on macOS):

```powershell
cd backends/ooa-godot
git remote add my-fork https://github.com/YOUR-ACCOUNT/ooa-godot.git
git switch -c my-feature
# make and validate one focused change
git diff --check
git push -u my-fork my-feature
```

If `my-fork` already exists, use it rather than adding it again. For a change
that also needs launcher work, keep that in a separate Epoch PR. The Epoch PR
can then update the pinned submodule commit and link the reviewed Godot PR.

## Build and validation

- Godot 4.7.1 with .NET support
- .NET 8 SDK
- PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) for repository scripts (Windows, macOS, or Linux)

### macOS setup (Apple silicon and Intel)

1. Install the .NET 8 SDK and PowerShell 7. For example, with Homebrew:

   ```sh
   brew install --cask dotnet-sdk powershell
   ```

2. Download the official **Godot 4.7.1 .NET / Mono** macOS universal build from
   [Godot's releases](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-builds/releases/tag/4.7.1-stable),
   unzip it, and locate the executable inside the `.app` bundle, typically
   `Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot`.
3. From the repository root, run the build and full suite:

   ```sh
   dotnet build --configuration Debug --warnaserror
   pwsh ./tools/validate_parallel.ps1 -Godot "/Applications/Godot_mono.app/Contents/MacOS/Godot"
   git diff --check
   ```

   You can omit `-Godot` after adding the executable to `PATH` as `godot`, or
   set `GODOT_BIN` to its full path. The validation runner starts headless
   workers and writes per-worker diagnostics under the system temporary folder.

To regenerate imported game assets, also clone the supported vanilla
`oracles-disasm` checkout and point the importer at it and your locally held
clean US ROM (the ROM must never be committed):

   ```sh
   pwsh ./tools/import_oracles.ps1 \
     -Disassembly "/path/to/oracles-disasm" \
     -Rom "/path/to/Oracle of Ages (US).gbc"
   ```

Windows contributors can use the same commands with their Godot console
executable passed to `-Godot`; PowerShell 7 is recommended on every platform.

Run these from the repository root in PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`) on Windows or macOS:

```powershell
dotnet build
$env:GODOT_BIN = 'C:\path\to\Godot_v4.7.1-stable_mono_win64_console.exe'
& ./tools/validate_parallel.ps1
git diff --check
```

Build with zero warnings/errors. Gameplay changes require a focused source-backed
regression and the full parallel validation suite (all registered scenarios).
Documentation-only changes need `git diff --check` and link review. See
[development](docs/development.md), [validation](docs/validation.md), and
[project principles](docs/project-principles.md) for the detailed workflow.

## Attribution, contributions, and game content

Epoch's maintainer reports that the original project creator authorized the
`ZakyPew/ooa-godot` fork to continue development, modify and publicly

another source.

Never commit or attach a ROM, ROM dump, personal save, generated ROM-derived
asset, or other Nintendo game content. Use legally obtained game files locally
for validation; generated personal data belongs in ignored local paths, not a
PR. The Epoch root `LICENSE` applies only to Epoch-owned files and does not
